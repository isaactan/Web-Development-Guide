Why Web Development ?

In the past few years, the web has become a part of our everyday lives. We use websites for a lot of things from banking, shopping to reading daily news. Because of the high use of websites, the demand for web development is at its highest. What web developers can do is huge and this is why we have different sites despite there being so many.

### JavaScript

You can start learning JavaScript through CodeSchool (paid) and Codecademy (free). If you don’t know about these, they’re great websites that allow you to learn to code by coding inside the browser. Learning resources like this were the best when you are just getting started. Just be advised that this method of learning gets tiring quickly once you get into more advanced stuff, since their algorithms for checking whether you solved the code example correctly have some accuracy issues. Both of their introductory courses to JavaScript were outstanding and I highly recommend them.

Your assignment

2. Complete the basic JavaScript lesson on [CodeAcademy](http://codeacademy.com)
3. (optional) Read this book if you're really interested - [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) This is a        book about JavaScript, programming, and the wonders of the digital. 

Congratulation! You completed your javascript foundation.
